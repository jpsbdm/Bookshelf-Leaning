# 📚 BookSpace

Welcome to **BookSpace**, a fictional digital library created as a study project to explore full stack development — from semantic HTML to a functional back end with Node.js.

## ✨ Project Vision

BookSpace is a platform for cataloging and exploring books.  
The main goal is to serve as a **practical learning field** for the developer duo, **João and Múcio**, applying concepts of design, front-end development, accessibility, and back-end integration in a collaborative environment.

## 🚀 Project Versions

The development is divided into incremental versions:

- **v1.0.0:** Focused entirely on **semantic HTML**. Structure of all pages without CSS or JavaScript. The goal is to build a solid and accessible foundation.  
- **v2.0.0:** Implementation of **stable CSS** using the **“Dark Elegant”** visual theme, making the platform cohesive, modern, and responsive.  
- **v2.1.0 → v2.9.0:** Addition of **JavaScript interactivity**, feature by feature — such as dynamic navigation, form validation, and catalog filtering.  
- **v3.0.0:** Development and integration of a **basic Node.js/Express back end** to manage book data and, in the future, user accounts.
